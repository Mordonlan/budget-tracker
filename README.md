# menu
i choose the first option "budget data"

```python 
budget_data = {
    "balance": 500,
    "transactions": [
        {"type": "income", "amount": 1000, "description": "paycheck"},
        {"type": "expense", "amount": 500, "description": "groceries"},
    ]
}

```
i basically did an input command on visual studio for instance 
```python
def add_income(budget_data, amount, description):
def add_expense(budget_data, amount, description):
def show_balance(budget_data):
def show_transaction_history(budget_data):
def exit(budget_data):
"def add_income(budget_data, amount, description):"
we use the add income and the input needs to be budget data - meaning the iteam the amount - for exmaple if its 5 apples so it needs to be mentioned  and the description  - about the item
```
update the data structure based on the received data structure from the function 


# the files i added are already with explantion in the function file and it has a seprate main file with a loop enabled so it ensures the transcation goes clean
